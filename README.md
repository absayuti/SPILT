# SPILT
SPI (structured programming and interfacing course) Lab Test

SPILT started as a collection of BASH scripts. Each so-called command is a BASH script with an obviously named file such as view, submit, help and view As the needs grew, a python program was developed so that more features can be added from time to time.
